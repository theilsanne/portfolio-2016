                            Ambiánce provides a way to visualise the social media coverage of events around campus through a mobile application and interactive visualisation table, using geo-location and hashtag data taken from social media.

                        <p>
                            A large part of the current issue with the lack of social media presence is due to the lack of centralisation of social media content across platforms.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Having conducted a questionnaire to gauge the campus' social media impact on its students, I found that event awareness is limited despite users following some form of student life/campus life account. With this in mind, I proposed the following features:

                            I chose a vibrant and loud mood that complements abstract and organic forms. As an application that visualises campus aura, it only makes sense to have a vibrant scheme.

                            The first round of compositions followed the wireframes very closely, and was too conservative and clean for the vibrant and exciting mood that the application was meant to be.

                            Much more vibrant and visually interesting in style, the final composition lives up to the hype that the application promises to bring with carefully placed graphical elements and attention-catching visualisations of campus event aura.

                            This project was very tough, as there was a time crunch but I was ambitious regardless to complete many assets for the presentation. In doing so I truly understood the amount of time and effort it takes to pull together a project presentation that I myself would be proud of showing, within a short time frame.
