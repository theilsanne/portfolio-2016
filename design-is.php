                        <p>
                            This project is a visual definition of the definition of design (on my terms). Designed for my Elements II course, I chose process because of the intricacies of design - the process is just as important as the result. As such, I chose to combine both digital and traditional media to drive home that exact point.

                        <p>
                            Because traditional media was used, I wanted to really mimic the process of perfecting an initially hand-lettered phrase. I had layers of tracing paper laid down, with each layer building upon the next. These were scanned and cleaned up in Photoshop, in which I created the vector handle graphics and used a tablet to help in shading the final two letters.

                            I had an alternative solution, where the process of one character was tracked, specifically the letter 'n'. This way, there would be an evolution of the process.

                            In order to highlight the definition, I decided to <em>show</em> it, quite literally. In doing so, I was able to learn a lot about all facets of the process behind a design.
