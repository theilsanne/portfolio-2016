                        <p>
                            This series of posters was designed for my New Media Design Elements I final project, the subject matter being a selected social issue. I chose to design for the Education for All cause.

                        <p>
                            I am a passionate advocate for <strong>Education for All</strong> / equality in having an education, especially having volunteered for the cause previously. Thus, I decided to go back to the roots, and thought about an object symbolic of school (pencil), something that restricts or that noone would touch willingly (barbed wire), and a medium (traditional ink drawing + digital art). 
                        </p>

                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        
                        <p>
                            The idea of barbed wire did not come until a later iteration of my idea. I had originally planned to incorporate real objects, but through iteration, it was clear that I had to re-think my plan of action.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            I began with a "barrier" built out of writing utensils, then to a less cluttered iteration of a hand with no pencil, the last of which resembles the final solution the closest.  
                        </p>

                        <div class="box half">
                            <p>
                                When I had decided that barbed wire pencils were a good direction in which the project should go, I had several iterations to explore all possible compositions.
                            </p>

                                From sketching, to drawing in ink, to digitising, this hand-drawn illustration gives the poster a personal touch.
                            </p>

                                Because of the gravity of the message, yet the simplicity of the imagery, I also added a universally known sign to symbolise the intangibility of education. This <em>Restricted</em> sign, in addition to the barbed wires, exudes hostility.

                            The posters below are a series that stemmed from the idea as a whole. I had initially penned in "Let Them Learn" as a title, but in the final submission left the graphic to do the talking. I explored more school-related imagery below, but I felt that the symbol of a pencil was the strongest.

                            Visualising social issues is a strong way of communicating emotional depth. In the case of this project, that depth is the intangibility of education.
